# Contributing to NoteDiscovery

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NoteDiscovery! 🎉

This document provides guidelines and expectations for contributing to the project. Please read through this before submitting pull requests or opening issues.

## 🤝 Our Philosophy

NoteDiscovery is designed to be:
- **Lightweight** - Fast, minimal dependencies, quick to deploy
- **Simple** - Easy to understand, maintain, and customize
- **Self-hosted** - Complete control over your data, no external dependencies
- **Privacy-focused** - Your notes stay on your server

When considering contributions, we prioritize:
1. Maintaining simplicity and ease of use
2. Keeping the codebase maintainable
3. Preserving the lightweight nature of the application
4. Staying true to the self-hosted, privacy-first mission

## 📋 Before You Start

### Discuss Major Changes First

**Before submitting a pull request for a major feature or significant change, please:**

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the idea
2. **Wait for feedback** from maintainers
3. **Get approval** before investing time in implementation

This helps ensure that:
- Your effort isn't wasted if the feature doesn't align with project goals
- We can discuss the best approach together
- Multiple people aren't working on the same thing
- The feature fits well with the existing architecture

### What Counts as a "Major Change"?

- New features that add significant functionality
- Changes to core architecture or data models
- New dependencies or significant changes to existing ones
- UI/UX overhauls or major design changes
- Changes to the plugin or theme system architecture
- Breaking changes to the API

### AI-Assisted Contributions

AI tools are welcome here — parts of NoteDiscovery are written with them. What matters is that a human has understood and verified the change before it arrives:

- **Describe what the code actually does** - The title and description should match the diff. A mismatch is the quickest way to stall a review.
- **Run it** - Generated changes should be tested locally, not just read.
- **Keep it focused** - One concern per pull request. Unrelated edits bundled in — logging tweaks, formatting, drive-by refactors — will be asked to come out.
- **Be ready to explain it** - If a reviewer asks why a change is correct, "the model suggested it" isn't an answer.

Small, well-scoped fixes are genuinely appreciated. Volume of generated patches isn't a goal in itself.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/notediscovery.git
cd notediscovery
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your changes locally
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python run.py

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add dark mode toggle to settings"
```

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- A clear title and description
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots (if UI changes)
- Testing notes

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add docstrings for public functions/classes

### JavaScript

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Keep functions focused and small
- Comment complex logic

### General

- Keep code simple and readable
- Avoid over-engineering
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Write self-documenting code when possible

## 🎨 Contributing Themes

Themes should:
- Follow the existing theme structure (see `themes/` directory)
- Be well-tested across different content types
- Include proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Be named descriptively (e.g., `ocean-blue.css`, not `theme1.css`)

## 🔌 Contributing Plugins

Contributed plugins go in `plugins/contrib/`. That folder ships with the project
but is never loaded — users install one by copying it into `plugins/`. Every
deployment stays lean by default, and a plugin can't break someone who never
asked for it.

A plugin there should:
- **Be one self-contained file** - no packages, no companion modules
- **Add no dependencies** beyond `requirements.txt`
- **Need no core changes** - if the existing hooks can't support it, open an issue first
- **Document itself** in a module docstring - what it does, how it's triggered, how to install it, and anything known to be rough
- **Fail quietly** - a plugin that raises is logged and skipped, so don't leave the app depending on it

Please don't add it to `documentation/PLUGINS.md`. That file covers the plugin
*system*; the contrib folder is its own index, which is what keeps two plugin
PRs from conflicting. See [plugins/contrib/README.md](plugins/contrib/README.md)
for the docstring format, and `documentation/PLUGINS.md` for the hooks, plugin
context, and routes you can build on.

Plugins are promoted into `plugins/` and shipped enabled only at the maintainers'
discretion.

## 🌍 Contributing Translations

NoteDiscovery supports multiple languages through JSON locale files. Adding a new language is easy!

### How to Add a New Language

1. **Copy the English locale file:**
   ```bash
   cp locales/en-US.json locales/xx-XX.json
   ```
   Use the appropriate [BCP 47 language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (e.g., `pt-BR`, `ja-JP`, `zh-CN`).

2. **Update the `_meta` section:**
   ```json
   {
     "_meta": {
       "code": "xx-XX",
       "name": "Language Name",
       "flag": "🇽🇽"
     },
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **Translate all string values:**
   - Keep the keys exactly as they are (don't translate keys!)
   - Translate only the values
   - Preserve `{{placeholders}}` - they get replaced with dynamic values
   - Keep emoji prefixes like `✓`, `💡`, `📂` as they are universal

4. **Test your translation:**
   - Restart the application
   - Go to Settings → Language dropdown
   - Your new language should appear automatically
   - Click through the UI to verify translations

### Translation Guidelines

- **Be consistent** - Use the same terminology throughout
- **Match the tone** - NoteDiscovery uses friendly, concise language
- **Preserve formatting** - Keep `\n` for newlines in multi-line strings
- **Handle plurals simply** - It uses `{{count}}` placeholders (e.g., "hace {{count}}m")
- **Test date formats** - Dates are formatted using the browser's `Intl` API with your locale code

### What Gets Translated

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| UI Labels | Button text, panel titles, tooltips |
| Messages | Alerts, confirmations, prompts |
| Placeholders | Search box, editor hints |
| Relative times | "just now", "5m ago", "2d ago" |

### What Stays in English

- Technical terms: "Wikilinks", "Markdown", "HTML"
- Keyboard shortcuts in tooltips: "Ctrl+Z", "Esc"
- File extensions: ".md", ".json"

## 📚 Contributing Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! Please:
- Keep language clear and concise
- Use examples where helpful
- Update related documentation when making changes
- Check for typos and grammar

## ❓ When PRs Might Not Be Accepted

Even if your idea is great, a PR might not be accepted if:

1. **It doesn't align with project goals** - We aim to keep NoteDiscovery lightweight and simple. Features that add significant complexity or dependencies may not fit.

2. **It wasn't discussed first** - Major changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation.

3. **It conflicts with existing work** - Sometimes we're already working on similar features or have different plans.

4. **It's too niche** - Features that only benefit a very small subset of users might be better as plugins.

5. **It adds unnecessary complexity** - We prefer simple, maintainable solutions over complex ones.

6. **It breaks backward compatibility** - Without a very good reason, we try to maintain compatibility.

7. **It's generated code that hasn't been verified** - Plausible-looking changes that were never run, or whose description doesn't match the diff, will be sent back rather than reviewed line by line.

### What to Do If Your PR Isn't Accepted

**Don't take it personally!** Here are some options:

1. **Fork and maintain your own version** - That's the beauty of open source! You can add any features you want in your fork.

2. **Create a plugin** - Many features can be implemented as plugins without changing core code.

3. **Revisit later** - Project priorities change. What doesn't fit now might fit later.

4. **Discuss alternatives** - We're happy to discuss if there's a simpler way to achieve your goal.
