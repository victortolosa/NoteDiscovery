# 🔌 Plugin System

NoteDiscovery includes a powerful plugin system that lets you extend functionality without modifying core code.

## How Plugins Work

Plugins are Python files that live in the `plugins/` directory. They use **event hooks** to react to actions in the app:

### Available Hooks

| Hook | When Triggered | Parameters | Can Modify |
|------|----------------|------------|------------|
| `on_note_create` | New note is created | `note_path`, `initial_content` | ✅ Yes (return modified content) |
| `on_note_save` | Note is being saved | `note_path`, `content` | ✅ Yes (return transformed content, or None) |
| `on_note_load` | Note is loaded from disk | `note_path`, `content` | ✅ Yes (return transformed content, or None) |
| `on_note_delete` | Note is deleted | `note_path` | ❌ No |
| `on_search` | Search is performed | `query`, `results` | ✅ Yes (return a replacement result list, or None) |
| `on_app_startup` | App starts up | None | ❌ No |

Every hook that can modify follows the same rule: **return a new value to replace
the one you were given, or return `None` to leave it alone.** Plugins run in
filename order, each receiving what the previous one left behind. A plugin that
raises is logged and skipped — the value keeps its last good state, so one broken
plugin can't take down a request.

Replacements must be the right type (`str` for content hooks, `list` for
`on_search`). Anything else is logged and ignored rather than passed on.

### Search result ordering

Core search results are re-sorted by path before pagination, so that paging
through them stays reproducible while notes are being edited. If your `on_search`
returns its own list, that sort is skipped and your order is preserved — which
also makes the order your responsibility. Return results in a stable order
(due date, name, relevance score), not one that shifts between calls, or paginated
clients can see duplicates.

## Bundled and Contributed Plugins

`note_stats` ships in `plugins/` and loads at startup. Community plugins live in
`plugins/contrib/`, which the loader ignores — install one by copying it into
`plugins/` and restarting. Each carries its own documentation in its docstring;
see [plugins/contrib/README.md](../plugins/contrib/README.md).

## Creating a Plugin

### 1. Create a Python file

```bash
cd notediscovery/plugins
touch my_plugin.py
```

### 2. Define your plugin class

Every plugin must have a `Plugin` class with:
- `name` - Display name
- `version` - Version string
- `enabled` - Whether it's active (default: `True`)

### 3. Implement event hooks

Add methods for the events you want to handle. Method names are checked at load
time: an `on_*` method that isn't a known hook gets a warning in the log rather
than silently never running.

## Plugin Context

If your plugin defines `setup(ctx)`, it's called once at startup before any hook
fires. Use it instead of trying to work out where things live yourself — the
context always agrees with the running app, including `NOTES_DIR` overrides.

| Field | What it is |
|-------|-----------|
| `ctx.notes_dir` | `Path` to the vault the app is actually serving |
| `ctx.plugins_dir` | `Path` to the plugins directory |
| `ctx.config` | The resolved app config dict |
| `ctx.logger` | Logger named for your plugin, output goes to the server log |

```python
class Plugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "My Plugin"
        self.version = "1.0.0"
        self.enabled = True

    def setup(self, ctx):
        self.notes_dir = ctx.notes_dir
        self.log = ctx.logger
        self.log.info("ready, watching %s", self.notes_dir)
```

## Plugin Routes

A plugin can serve its own HTTP endpoints by returning an `APIRouter` from
`get_routes()`. Routes are mounted under `/api/plugins/<plugin_id>/` and inherit
the app's authentication.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

class Plugin:
    # ... name / version / enabled as above ...

    def get_routes(self) -> APIRouter:
        router = APIRouter()

        @router.get("/summary")
        async def summary():
            if not self.enabled:
                return {"enabled": False}
            return {"enabled": True, "notes": 42}

        return router
```

That endpoint is then reachable at `/api/plugins/my_plugin/summary`. Routes are
mounted at startup whether or not the plugin is enabled, so check `self.enabled`
inside the handler if it should go quiet when toggled off.

The bundled `note_stats` plugin uses both of these — see `plugins/note_stats.py`
for a working example.

## Basic Example: Note Logger

This simple plugin logs note activity to Docker logs (visible with `docker-compose logs -f`):

```python
"""
Note Logger Plugin
Logs all note operations to Docker logs for monitoring
"""

class Plugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Note Logger"
        self.version = "1.0.0"
        self.enabled = True
    
    def on_note_save(self, note_path: str, content: str) -> str | None:
        """Log when a note is saved"""
        word_count = len(content.split())
        print(f"💾 Note saved: {note_path} ({word_count} words)")
        return None  # Don't modify content, just observe
    
    def on_note_delete(self, note_path: str):
        """Log when a note is deleted"""
        print(f"🗑️  Note deleted: {note_path}")
    
    def on_search(self, query: str, results: list) -> list | None:
        """Log search queries"""
        print(f"🔍 Search: '{query}' → {len(results)} results")
        return None  # Don't touch the results, just observe
```

### How to see the logs

```bash
# View logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker-compose logs -f notediscovery
```

## Activating Your Plugin

1. **Place the file** in `plugins/` directory
2. **Restart the app**: `docker-compose restart`
3. **Plugin auto-loads**: Plugins with `enabled = True` will automatically load

### Enable/Disable Plugins via API

Use the API to toggle plugins on/off:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Enable a plugin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/plugins/note_logger/toggle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'

# Disable a plugin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/plugins/note_logger/toggle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Enable a plugin
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/plugins/note_logger/toggle -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"enabled\": true}"

# Disable a plugin
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/plugins/note_logger/toggle -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"enabled\": false}"
```

**List all plugins (all platforms):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/plugins
```

## Plugin State Persistence

Plugin states (enabled/disabled) are saved in `plugins/plugin_config.json` and persist between restarts.

💡 **Tip:** Use `print()` statements in plugins to log to Docker logs for debugging and monitoring!
